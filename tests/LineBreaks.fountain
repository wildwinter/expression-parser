Murtaugh, springing hell bent for leather -- and folks, grab your hats … because just then, a BELL COBRA HELICOPTER crests the edge of the bluff.

An explosion of sound…
As it rises like an avenging angel …
Hovers, shattering the air with turbo-throb, sandblasting the hillside with a roto-wash of loose dirt, tables, chairs, everything that’s not nailed down …

Screaming, chaos, frenzy.
Three words that apply to this scene.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

THE DEALER eyes the new player warily.

SCANNING THE AISLES…
Where is that pit boss?

No luck. He has no choice to deal the cards.
